Performance bit:board is expected to bring an educational impact (especially in computer science) to the user. It has to be a keyboard that includes touch sensors and utilises the Bluetooth Low Energy(BLE) functionality and As our target audience is children aged 11-12, user interface should be easy-to-use. Environment During transport, storage and usage, bit:board should be able to withstand moderate impact and normal conditions such as average humidity and temperature. Life in Service bit:board aims for a long life span(i.e. 2 years), working for 1-2 hours a day. Materials chosen should be robust for long usage. Maintenance No professional maintenance required as all components would be hidden from the user for safety reason. Common maintenance includes change of batteries and cleaning of surface of touch sensors for better sensitivity. Target Product Cost Aims to have the retail price to be lower than the BBC micro:bit (~\u00a317). Hence, for mass production, PCB would be designed to include touch sensors on board to lower cost for components. Competition There is no similar products in the market at the moment - no accessories so far makes use of BLE and includes a canvas as controller. There are micro:bit accessories that functions as game controllers such as :GAME ZIP64 and bit:commander. In addition, micro:bit accessory that includes touch sensors is touch:bit. Shipping bit:board is likely to be in batch production. Since it will be manufactured and distributed in the UK, local carriers can be used to send bit:boards from manufacturer to distributor. Shipping of bit:board to international users would be done by distributor. Packaging An outer housing to pack the bit:board will be required when in transportation. Quantity Generally, the production volume will be in small incremental steps. To test the water, an initial volume of 200 units will be produced. If the launch of bit:board is successful, then batch volume should be increased by 100 units at each milestone. Manufacturing Facility For mass production, PCB is likely to be printed by an external manufacturer, meaning that manufacture of PCBs would be outsourced. For the outer layers of bit:board, a laser cutter is needed. If the cost of production for laser cutting is desirable, then it is likely to be outsourced as well. Customer Target audience of bit:board is children aged 11-12. Parents are also potential customers as bit:board encourages interactions between parents and children, teacher and students. Size Should be smaller or equal to A4 size (i.e. 21.0 x 29.7cm) to be able to fit inside a typical school bag Weight Should be lightweight to reduce the pressure on the user when carrying bit:board around. Yet, bit:board does not need to be lifted up during usage, so being weight-efficient would not be a concern. Materials To reduce the impact on the environment, bit:board's outer layer would be made from wood (i.e. birch plywood 3mm). Electrical components such as 4 touch sensors, a joystick, 4 IC switches, 4 LEDs, edge connector and wires would be needed. Adhesives are also needed to put wood pieces together. Product Life Span bit:board would be in the market for around a year, and a new improved version would be developed in the mean time. Aesthetics, Appearance and Finish Since bit:board is made from birch plywood, bit:board would make use of the natural wood pattern, smoothed out using sandpaper of 300-400 grit, finished by applying a layer of Beeswax for aesthetic. Ergonomics bit:board is designed to be used while sitting on a surface. There should be no sharp edges or corner and should be smooth to touch. The inputs should be placed at suitable distance from each other, so they are not too far or too near to each other. Standards and Specification If bit:board is released to the European micro:bit accessories market, then it must obtain the CE mark and the BSI Kitemark. Quality and Reliability Mean time before repair : depends on the battery life Mean time before failure : since electrical wiring and components are enclosed, with the robust design of bit:board, it should be able to last as long as the life expectancy before any failure Shelf Life(storage) bit:board should be stored in a cool,dry place to prevent any issue rising from the electronic components Testing BLE should be tested before being released to the market Processes Laser cutting of the wooden case Creation of MakeCode package Circuit Design Time Scale Idea generation from meeting with client - Summer term week 0-1 Product, leaflet and poster design - Summer term week 2-6 Hackbooth demonstration - Summer term week 7 Documentation - Summer term week 8-9 Safety Legal guidelines To make bit:board available on the market, all parameters must abide to the EU safety regulations Manufacturing Hazards Wiring must not be exposed, and multimeter should be used to check if electrically safe Operational Hazards Rough use and violent treatment of product should be avoided even though robustness is taken into account in product design Company Constraints We are limited to \u00a3500 budget. Third-party suppliers must be approved by Imperial College London. Market Constraints Market constraints are difficult to estimate as there is not much data on the micro:bit accessories market. Moreover, there are no similar implementation in the market, so there are no references to take from. Patents, Literature and Product Data No patents are needed Legal Not Applicable Political and Social Implications bit:board promotes science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) and aims to improve the understanding in the field of computer science. Installation Users are only required to replace the canvas and insert the micro:bit into the edge connector of bit:board for the operation. Documentation Documentation is made into GitHub pages for references: http://t-tht.github.io/bitboard-docs-mkdocs/ Disposal As birch plywood is used for the casing, most parts of the bit:board are recyclable. However, electrical components (e.g. batteries, touch sensors and joystick) should be separated from the bit:board before disposal to reduce impact on the environment.","title":"Product Design Specification"},{"location":"PDS/#product-design-specification-pds","text":"The PDS describes requirements that bit:board ought to meet to satisfy the problem statement.","title":"Product Design Specification (PDS)"},{"location":"PDS/#performance","text":"bit:board is expected to bring an educational impact (especially in computer science) to the user.

The following circuit diagram illustrates how the inputs are interconnected and shows the necessary components required to complement the inputs. Based on the circuit diagram above, the components required for the prototype were soldered onto a stripboard. The following layout was designed to keep all the components compact in order to reduce the area required. Components Required: Joystick Capacitive Touch Sensor Bi-colour LED Switch Resistor micro:bit Breakout Board Joystick The joystick used has two axes and it is commonly used to represent the arrow keys on a keyboard. Each axis is a potentiometer and they are independent of each other. By dividing the voltage applied to the joystick, analogue inputs can be sent to the analogue pins of the micro:bit. These analogue readings will then be used to set thresholds when determining the sensitivity of the joystick. Capacitive Touch Sensor This sensor can detect touch by measuring the change in capacitance. It is a breakout board that utilises the TTP223 IC, which has touch detection. The IC is in direct mode and has an active high output. This means that the output will go high whenever the touch pad is touched and will go back to low when touch is not detected. A digital pin from the micro:bit can be used to read the output of this sensor. Bi-colour LED Instead of a standard LED that has a single colour when it lights up, two colours were used to indicate different states: touched and not touched. This LED is either green or red when it lights up. It is essentially two LEDs that share a common cathode, causing it to have three leads. Switch This is a MAX4544 switch, which is a single-pole, double-throw (SPDT) analogue switch. It can be used to complete either one of the two available circuits depending on a single digital input. When the input is driven high, the switch will close the circuit that is connected via the normally open (NO) terminal. If a low input is applied instead, the switch will then toggle back to the normally closed (NC) terminal. Resistor The use of resistors in the prototype stripboard is to control the amount of current in the circuit, in order to prevent any damages to the LEDs. By allowing more current to flow, the LEDs will glow brighter. For a significant brightness, a 220 \u03a9 resistor is used for green light and a 750 \u03a9 resistor is used for red light. micro:bit Breakout Board An edge connector is used to allow direct access to the pins of the micro:bit. However, a breakout board is required for the prototype stripboard because the pitch of the edge connector is too narrow for the stripboard. The breakout board used also reduced the number of pins from the edge connector to the actual number of distinct pins available from the micro:bit.","title":"Circuit Diagram"},{"location":"circuit_diagram/#circuit-diagram","text":"A stripboard was used to connect the fixed set of inputs (joystick and touch sensors) to the BBC micro:bit.

It has been proven that micro:bit reacts to hand-drawn buttons using graphite pencils, which make use of capacitive touch sensing. sketch:it makes use of this property; users can draw their own buttons, hence creating their own controller. Physical features sketch:it includes fixed inputs: 4 touch sensors and a joystick. micro:bit is connected to the sketch:it via the edge connector to use the fixed inputs. If the user opts to use hand-drawn buttons, then they can simply insert the micro:bit into the space next to the edge connector. The user draws the buttons on paper and slide it into the slot at the bottom of the sketch:it. With micro:bit inserted into the space, connection is established between the graphite tracks and the edge of micro:bit. triangle:bit triangle:bit takes its inspiration from Scrabble Flash from Hasbro Games, which consists of 5 electronic blocks; each block shows a letter and blocks are put together to make words. triangle:bit works on a similar idea, where blocks of inputs are put together along with the main block according to the user's liking to form different shapes. As seen from above, this design allows flexibility in shapes of the product, making customization easy.

The difference between bit:board and sketch:it is that bit:board is more oriented to developing an understanding of electronic circuits; bit:board makes pins of micro:bit more accessible, giving more flexibility in input creation. Canvas The canvas should ideally take the size of A5, and held down by clips which is hard-wired to pins of micro:bit and should also allow electrical connection to realize any 'components' (i.e. buttons or potentiometers) drawn.

Hardware Test 1: Individual electronic components Joystick When the joystick knob was slowly moved towards the up/ right position, their corresponding output values increase until slightly below the 3V applied. The output values work the other way round when the knob was moved towards the down/ left position, decreasing until close to GND . Touch Sensor When a finger was placed on the touch sensor pad, the output signal went high . When removed , the signal went low . Test 2: Multiple components on a breadboard LED, Switch Touch Sensor When the touch pad was touched , the colour of the LED changed from red to green . When the finger was lifted off the pad, the colour changed back to red . Joystick Touch Sensor Circuit When the joystick and the touch sensor circuit were used together, both outputs were still detectable since they worked independently . Test 3: Breadboard with micro:bit Joystick The following programme was used to test the joystick with the analogue input pins. When the joystick knob is moved in a specific direction then returned to the middle, the red dot on the LED screen moved a step in that direction as well. The threshold values were adjusted to set the sensitivity of the joystick. let y = 0 let x = 0 let reading_y = 0 let reading_x = 0 let dot = game.createSprite(2, 2) basic.forever(function(){ reading_x = pins.analogReadPin(AnalogPin.P0) reading_y = pins.analogReadPin(AnalogPin.P1) if (reading_x 800){ x = x + 1 } else if (reading_x 200){ x = x - 1 } else{ x = x } if (reading_y 800){ y = y - 1 } else if (reading_y 200){ y = y + 1 } else{ y = y } dot.set(LedSpriteProperty.X, x) dot.set(LedSpriteProperty.Y, y) basic.pause(100) }) Touch Sensor The following programme was used to test the touch sensor with the digital input pins. When one of the numbered touch pads were touched, the corresponding number appeared on the LED screen. basic.forever(function(){ if (pins.digitalReadPin(DigitalPin.P13) == 1){ basic.showNumber(1) } if (pins.digitalReadPin(DigitalPin.P14) == 1){ basic.showNumber(2) } if (pins.digitalReadPin(DigitalPin.P15) == 1){ basic.showNumber(3) } if (pins.digitalReadPin(DigitalPin.P16) == 1){ basic.showNumber(4) } if (pins.digitalReadPin(DigitalPin.P8) == 1){ basic.showNumber(8) } }) Both Inputs Simultaneously The two programmes used were combined to test whether the micro:bit was able to supply enough current for the implementation of the two inputs. Both results were able to be displayed, showing that the inputs can be used together. Test 4: Electrical conductivity Pencil (Graphite) Track Graphite conducts electricity but it could not be used to replace wires because it has a very high resistance , causing a huge voltage drop from one end to the other. It was used as a potentiometer instead since different voltage readings could be obtained at different points. Copper Tape Copper is a good conductor and there is no voltage drop across it. The adhesive side of the copper tape is conductive as well. Cable Clip The clip is made from copper but plated with tin . The clip is able to conduct electricity despite having the coating. allowing the clip to be used not just for securing the paper canvas but also as an electrical connection point. Software Test 1: Custom MakeCode extension Custom blocks that provide different keys of a keyboard were created using TypeScript and they were tested on the MakeCode Playground to visualise the format of the blocks. Test 2: Custom keyboard services Instead of just sending \"string\" via Bluetooth, keyboard commands such as enter and backspace were tested using the microbit_presenter mbed file. Hardware Software Integration Test 1: Fixed inputs Joystick Thresholds for the analogue inputs were adjusted via trial and error to give the best joystick sensitivity. When the joystick knob was moved, the cursor on a word document moved in the same direction as well. Touch Sensor Some keys were represented by the touch sensors and they were outputted on a laptop screen when the touch pads were touched. Continuous outputs were shown on the screen when the finger was resting on the touch pad. Test 2: Paper canvas Pencil (Graphite) Track Crocodile clips were used to connect one of the cable clips that corresponded to an analogue input pin to a particular position on the graphite track. Different analogue readings could be obtained at different positions on the graphite track. Copper Tape Copper tape was used on the paper and the cable clips were in contact with the tape. When the copper tape was powered with 3V, the cable clip corresponding to a digital input pin could be detected, leading to a key output on the laptop screen. Test 3: Demo examples Online Game (Crossy Road) Simple online games that only require basic keys such as the arrow keys and some other keys, like WASD and spacebar , can be played using the prototype. Custom Game (Wire Loop Game) Copper tape was used to create boundaries of a track and connected to the 3V cable clip. The micro:bit will detect a high signal when the tip of the crocodile clip touches the tape. The game interface was created using Python to receive key presses from the micro:bit. Output Selector Different threshold points were used to set the boundaries on the graphite track for different output modes. 4 modes were made to illustrate letters , numbers , symbols and commands . The touch pads will then correspond to the different key outputs based on the position of the crocodile clip.","title":"Test Verification"},{"location":"test_verification/#test-verification","text":"To ensure that the prototype is working as intended, a few tests were conducted at different stages to identify any faults in hardware and bugs in software.","title":"Test &amp; Verification"},{"location":"test_verification/#hardware","text":"","title":"Hardware"},{"location":"test_verification/#test-1-individual-electronic-components","text":"Joystick When the joystick knob was slowly moved towards the up/ right position, their corresponding output values increase until slightly below the 3V applied.
